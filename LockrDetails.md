# Lockr Password Manager and More !!!!!!

Lockr is all about privacy and safeguarding datas of different varieties (e.g. images, audios, videos, documents, etc). It's a comprehensive personal vault or engrypted digital safe. It's core concept is to encrypt files, decrypts them only on users requests and authentication, store metadata securely and also support importing and exporting of files securely. It's starting as my first well planned projects. I really want this projects to go on an extreme large scale, till the point that, it's either it fetch me income or it's open source for the community to use.

## Objectives

To research, design, and build a cross-platform password manager in Python, starting with simple and evolving into a secure, full-featured product with CLI, GUI, Web and Mobile interfaces.

## Project Foundation 

> What's unique about Lockr? 

1. Offline-First with Optional Encrypted Sync 
    - Local vault by default
    - Option to sync via encrypted Git repo, Dropbox, or WebDAV - zero cloud lock-in 
2. Fully Encrypted Vault (Metadata + Content)
    - Not just passwords - encrypt titles, notes, usernames, etc 
    - Inspired by KeePassXC, but better UX 
3. Command-Line + GUI in One 
    - CLI-First: pass add, pass ls, pass copy 
    - Optional GUI built on Kivy or PyQt - Minimal & fast 
4. Pluggable Storage Backend 
    - Support Multiple Storage Engines(Encrypted SQLite, JSON + Fernet, Remote GPG-Encrypted file)
    - Easy to switch backend via config
5. Developer-Friendly API/SDK 
    - Python SDK to interact with vault from script 
    - Example: auto-login scripts, integration with dotfiles 
6. Biometric + System integration
    - Optional use of fingerprint/FaceID via system keyrings
    - Clipboard timer, secure auto-type, etc 
7. Vault Activity Graph: Shwo visual stats (access, edits, weak passwords)
8. Darknet Backup Option: Onion service to sync encrypted vault 
9. Emergency Unlock Kit: Export time-locked rescue file for trusted contact 
10. Plugin System: Extend functionality with Python Plugin

## Audience

1. Tech-Savvy Users & Developers
- Want control over their data (open-source, offline options)
- Care about security and auditability 
- Comfortable with CLI or scripting automation 

2. Privacy-Conscious Users 
- Avoid cloud-based tools (LasPass, Bitwarden) due to breaches 
- Want a tool that never phones home 
- Prefer encrypted local vaults 

3. Linux and Power Users 
- Often underserved by flashy GUI apps 
- Appreciate terminal-first interfaces with optional GUI 
- Want integration with Linux keyring, DBus, system tray, etc

| Pluggable backends               | Customizable by user                           | 


### Phase 1: Research and Planning

#### Key Research Areas

1. What a Password Manager Does:
   1. Store and retrieve passwords securely
   2. Generate strong passwords
   3. Encrypt Data
   4. Sync Across Devices (Optional)
   5. Autofill login forms (Advanced)
2. Core Concepts:
   1. Encryption (AES, Fernet, Key Derivation with PBKDF2 or bcrypt)
   2. Secure storage (SQLite, JSON, or file-based initially)
   3. Master password (never stored, used to unlock vault)
   4. Zero-Knowledge design (no one else can see passwords)
3. Python Libraries:
   1. cryptography - for encryption
   2. sqlite3 - for storage
   3. argparse, click or typer - for CLI
   4. tkinter or PyQt - for GUI
   5. Flask or FastAPI - for web backend
   6. Kivy or BeeWare - for mobile apps (using python)

### Phase 2: Minimal CLI Password Manager (MVP)

#### Features

1. Initialize a password vault (with master password)
2. Add, retrieve, delete credentials
3. Encrypt and Decrypt passwords
4. Local storage in encrypted form

#### Tech Stack

1. `Python` + `cryptography` + `sqlite3`
2. CLI using `argparse` or `typer`

### Phase 3: Extend to GUI

#### Features

1. Simple GUI interface for existing CLI features
2. Optional Password Generator

#### Tech Stack

1. `tkinter` (built-in) or `PyQt5`(More advanced)

### Phase 4: Web Interface

#### Features

1. Flask/FastAPI server with user authentication 
2. REST API for vault operations
3. Frontend with basic HTML/CSS/JS or a frontend framework like React

#### Security Additions

1. HTTPS
2. JWT tokens for session management
3. Server-side encryption with user's master password

### Phase 5: Mobile Interface

#### Approaches

1. `Kivy` - pure python cross platform
2. `BeeWare/Toga` - python to native mobile apps
3. Use Rest API from Phase 4 - mobile fronted in Flutter or React Native

## Future Features (Post MVP)

1. Biometric authentication (figerprint/face)
2. Auto-fill browser extension
3. Cloud Sync with encryption
4. Password health audit (weak/reused)
5. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
6. Offline mode with sync later

## Security Considerations

1. Always hash master passwords (e.g., bcrypt)
2. Use encryption (e.g AES-256 with derived key)
3. Salt + iterations to prevent brute-force attacks
4. Lockout after multiple failed logins
5. Don't log sensitive data

## Documentation & Testing

1. Write docstrings and usage guides
2. Unit tests with unittest or pytest
3. Store code in GitHub (private if sensitive)
