# Lockr ðŸ”’

**Lockr** is a secure, cross-platform vault for managing passwords and storing sensitive files like images, audios, videos and documents. It uses strong encryption to protect your data both at rest and in transit. It is written in Python. It provides simple secure local password storage with modern encryption and clean code structure, ideal for developers and privacy-focused users.

## Getting Started 

### 1. Clone the Repo 

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/aridswolfgangx/lockr.git 
cd lockr 
```
---

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

```bash 
python -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate 

```
--- 
### 3. Install Dependencies 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

--- 
### 4. Run the CLI 

```bash 
python cli/main.py store path/to/your/file.pdf 
python cli/main.py retrieve file.pdf output.pdf 
```

--- 
### How it works 

- Files are encrpted using a randomly generated key (Fernet)
- Encrypted files are saved to 'data/vault/'
- You can decrypt and restore them using the same key 
- Future support: Master password, user-based vaults, database storage 

--- 

## Security Notes 

- Encryption is powered by the 'cryptography' Python package 
- Keys should be derived from user master passwords (not implemented yet)
- Files are never stored in plaintext 

--- 

## To Do 

- [] Password vault with metadata 
- [] Key derivataion from user master password 
- [] GUI (Tkinter or PyQt)
- [] FastAPI based Web interface 
- [] Biometric unlock (platform-specific)
